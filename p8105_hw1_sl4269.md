Problem 1
=========

Neccessary packages

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

Introducing Variable Types and Coercion
---------------------------------------

### Data frame 1

``` r
data <- tibble(
  rvar = rnorm(8,0,1), #rvar = random variable N(0,1)
  logicv = rvar > 0, #logic vector of rvar > 0
  charv = as.character(rvar[]),#character vector of rvar
  facv = as.factor(
                cut(
                    rvar, 
                    3,
                    levels = c("1","2","3"), 
                    labels = FALSE, 
                    ordered_result = F))  #factor vecor of rvar 
)
```

### Nature of Variable Means

Taking the mean of every variable in dataframe1.

mean of random, logic, character, and factor variables respectively.

``` r
mean(pull(data, rvar))
```

    ## [1] 0.5141643

``` r
mean(pull(data,logicv))
```

    ## [1] 0.625

``` r
mean(pull(data,charv))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(data, facv))
```

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean of the character and factor variable did not work.

### AS.Numeric?

Converting the logic, character, and factor variale using as.numeric.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(data,logicv))
as.numeric(pull(data,charv))
as.numeric(pull(data,facv))
```

The logic vector prints as 1's and 0's. The character vector returns to a number format. Lastly, the factor variable returns the levels as numeric values.

Problem 2
=========

Introducing inline code, and Plots
----------------------------------

### Data frame 2

Creating a data frame of random variables.

``` r
data2 <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(500,0,1),
  y = rnorm(500,0,1),
  logic_xy = x + y > 1,
  nlogic_xy = as.numeric(logic_xy),
  flogic_xy = as.factor(logic_xy)
  
  )
```

Here are some discriptive statistics of data2. The size of this data set is 500 by 5. For the variable x, the mean is 0.0088, median ,0.061 and standard deviation is 1. The proportion of `x > y` is 0.504.

### Scatter plots of `x and y`

``` r
data2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y, color = logic_xy))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(color = "Logic vector", title = "X and Y Random Variables Colored by Logic Vector")
```

![](p8105_hw1_sl4269_files/figure-markdown_github/scatter%20plot-1.png)

``` r
data2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y, color = nlogic_xy))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(color = "Numeric\nLogic vector",title = "X and Y Random Variables Colored by Numeric Logic Vector")
```

![](p8105_hw1_sl4269_files/figure-markdown_github/scatter%20plot-2.png)

``` r
data2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y, color = flogic_xy))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(color = "Factored\nLogic vector",title = "X and Y Random Variables Colored by Factored Logic Vector")
```

![](p8105_hw1_sl4269_files/figure-markdown_github/scatter%20plot-3.png) In regards to how the variables were colored by the various vectors, I believe the logic vector and the factor factor vector are virtually the same. The numeric vector introduced decimal values in the scale that are not used.

### GGsave

Now I will save my ggplot scatter plots `ggsave`.

``` r
ggsave(filename = 'data2.jpeg', device = jpeg, dpi = 260, width = 3, height = 4, scale = 2, units = "in")
```
